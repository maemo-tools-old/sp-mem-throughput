sp-mem-throughput (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change in reported numbers for memcpy() and strcpy(): take both read and
    written bytes in account when reporting throughput.
  * New routine categories: strcmp, strncmp, strchr, strncpy
  * Include ARM strcmp() and strcpy() from bionic.git for benchmarking
    purposes.
  * Fixes: NB#226812 - memory throughput test should be extended to have
    str-specific tests
